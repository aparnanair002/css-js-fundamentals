.sidebar > .sidebar-content:first-child

Selects .sidebar-content that is:
- A direct child of .sidebar, and
- The first among all children inside .sidebar

Safer and more specific — ensures you’re only styling the first .sidebar-content directly inside .sidebar.
        </textarea>
        <div class="ap">Containing block</div>
        <div class="notes">
          The containing block is the area in which an element is positioned. It
          is determined by the nearest ancestor element that has a position
          value other than static (the default value). If no such ancestor
          exists, the containing block is the initial containing block, which
          is usually the viewport (the visible area of the web page).

          Absolute elements can only be contained by other elements using Positioned layout. 
          Here's how the algorithm works: When deciding where to place an absolutely-positioned element, it crawls up through the tree, looking for a Positioned ancestor. The first one it finds will provide the containing block

          When we set the position of an element using top / left / right / bottom, we're positioning the element based on the element's containing block. 
          If our element sets top: 0; left: 0, the element will be nestled in the top-left corner of the containing block.

          if no ancestoral element is found the element will be positioned according to the “initial containing block”. This is a box the size of the viewport, right at the top of the document.

    inherit proprty can be used to inherit the value of a property from its parent element.

    The truth is that Flow layout isn't really built with layering in mind. Most of the time, when we want to layer elements, we'll want to use positioned layout.
