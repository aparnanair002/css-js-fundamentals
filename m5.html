           <div class="notes">Nowadays, just about every phone comes with a "High DPI" display. DPI stands for "Dots Per Inch", and it refers to the pixel density. Apple has branded this the "Retina display", but the same technology is used on Android phones.

            And a pixel is not a square...its a point sample of color...thats why its dots per inch.
            Ngrok is a cross-platform application that allows developers to expose their local web servers to the internet.
            When you use Ngrok, you start it on your local machine and specify the port number of the local server that you want to expose. When you do that, Ngrok creates a secure tunnel to a public endpoint (a ngrok.io URL) that is accessible over the internet.
