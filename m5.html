           <div class="notes">Nowadays, just about every phone comes with a "High DPI" display. DPI stands for "Dots Per Inch", and it refers to the pixel density. Apple has branded this the "Retina display", but the same technology is used on Android phones.

            And a pixel is not a square...its a point sample of color...thats why its dots per inch.
            Ngrok is a cross-platform application that allows developers to expose their local web servers to the internet.
            When you use Ngrok, you start it on your local machine and specify the port number of the local server that you want to expose. When you do that, Ngrok creates a secure tunnel to a public endpoint (a ngrok.io URL) that is accessible over the internet.

           <div class="ap">Media Query</div>
           <div class="notes">The @media keyword is known as an "at-rule". at-rules are a special kind of CSS statement that changes behaviour. There are a handful of at-rules that all do different things; another example is @keyframes
             display: revert; //revert is a special keyword that restores the property to its default value.

            0-550px — Mobile
            550-1100px — Tablet
            1100-1500px — Laptop
            1500+px — Desktop
           </div>
           <textarea name="" id="">
            Some developers like to create queries for "exclusive" ranges. For example, if we wanted to target only tablet sizes—nothing smaller, nothing bigger—we could do this with the and keyword:

            @media (min-width: 550px) and (max-width: 1099.99px) {
              /* Tablet-only styles */
            }
           </textarea>
           <div class="ap">Container Queries</div>
           <div class="notes"> Container queries are like media queries, but instead of measuring the viewport, they measure an element’s container.</div>
           <textarea name="" id="">
            @container (min-width: 40rem) {
  .some-elem {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }
}
In this code snippet, the CSS will be applied if .some-elem’s container is 40rem or larger.
