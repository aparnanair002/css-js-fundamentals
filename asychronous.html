            You might be thinking why do i have a seperate page for Asynchronous Functions
            when i could have just added it to the JavaScript Basics page.
            The reason is that Asynchronous functions are a bit more complex and require a deeper understanding of JavaScript.
            So i decided to give it its own page to make it easier to understand.

            (it made me cry the first time i tried to learn it so hopefully this will help someone else not cry like me)
