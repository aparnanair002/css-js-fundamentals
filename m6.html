        While comparing chrome and safari, it was found that Chrome tucks the commas closer to the preceding word than Safari.
         the reason that the letter placement is slightly different between browsers is that the browsers implement different <b>kerning algorithms.</b>
         Using CSS, we can opt to disable kerning altogether with font-kerning: none, but we aren't offered any fine-grained control. letter-spacing, the property that allows us to increase/decrease the space between individual characters, acts as a "kerning multiplier"

This property allows us to switch which aliasing algorithm the browser uses. But, tragically, it only works on macOS, and only in Chrome/Safari/Edge (not Firefox).</textarea>

       <b> Kerning (character spacing)</b>

Chrome and Safari render text slightly differently.

Commas, letters, and spacing vary because each browser uses its own kerning algorithms.

Designers can tweak kerning manually with CSS (font-kerning: none + letter-spacing), but it’s tricky.

<b>Text rasterization & anti-aliasing</b>

Fonts are vectors, so browsers must “rasterize” them into pixels.

Anti-aliasing smooths edges, but each OS/browser has its own approach.

Windows uses subpixel rendering with colored edges (ClearType), macOS uses grayscale antialiasing.

<b>Font smoothing in CSS</b>

-webkit-font-smoothing (macOS only) lets you toggle antialiasing methods, but it’s limited.

Since macOS Mojave, Apple disabled subpixel antialiasing on Retina screens (too many tiny pixels, causes muddiness).

Firefox on macOS uses -moz-osx-font-smoothing, but it rarely makes a difference.

Windows browsers don’t expose smoothing controls via CSS.

<b>Accessibility debate</b>

Subpixel antialiasing was once considered crisper and better for readability (2012 article), but on modern high-DPI displays, grayscale antialiasing usually works better.

Browser rendering engines

Safari uses WebKit.

Chrome/Edge use Blink, a fork of WebKit.

That’s why many browsers still support -webkit- prefixed CSS.
