    “On two occasions I have been asked, ‘Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?’ [...] I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.”<br><br>

  </div>
  <p>Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms from which data structures are built. Many types of information require more than one atom, though. Objects allow us to group values—including other objects—to build more complex structures.</p>

  <p>The programs we have built so far have been limited by the fact that they were operating only on simple data types. After learning the basics of data structures in this chapter, you’ll know enough to start writing useful programs.</p>

  <h2>The List</h2>
  <pre><code>let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
console.log(listOfNumbers[2]); // → 5
console.log(listOfNumbers[0]); // → 2
console.log(listOfNumbers[2 - 1]); // → 3
</code></pre>

  <h2>Properties</h2>
  <pre><code>null.length;
// → TypeError: null has no properties</code></pre>

  <h2>Methods</h2>
  <pre><code>let doh = "Doh";
console.log(typeof doh.toUpperCase); // → function
console.log(doh.toUpperCase()); // → DOH
</code></pre>

  <h2>Objects</h2>
  <pre><code>let day1 = {
  squirrel: false,
  events: ["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running"]
};
console.log(day1.squirrel); // → false
</code></pre>

  <h2>Mutability</h2>
  <pre><code>let object1 = {value: 10};
let object2 = object1;
let object3 = {value: 10};
console.log(object1 == object2); // → true
console.log(object1 == object3); // → false
</code></pre>

  <h2>push into an array</h2>
  <pre><code>let journal = [];

function addEntry(events, squirrel) {
  journal.push({events, squirrel});
}
</code></pre>

  <h2>Computing Correlation</h2>
  <pre><code>function phi(table) {
  return (table[3] * table[0] - table[2] * table[1]) /
    Math.sqrt((table[2] + table[3]) *
              (table[0] + table[1]) *
              (table[1] + table[3]) *
              (table[0] + table[2]));
}

console.log(phi([76, 9, 4, 1]));
// → 0.068599434
</code></pre>

  <h2>Further Arrayology</h2>
  <pre><code>function remove(array, index) {
  return array.slice(0, index)
    .concat(array.slice(index + 1));
}
console.log(remove(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], 2));
// → ["a", "b", "d", "e"]
</code></pre>

<h2>Rest Parameter</h2>
  <pre><code>let words = ["never", "fully"];
console.log(["will", ...words, "understand"]);
// → ["will", "never", "fully", "understand"]
</code></pre>


<h2>Excercises  </h2>
The sum of a range
The introduction of this book alluded to the following as a nice way to compute the sum of a range of numbers:

console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to and including end.

Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the example program and see whether it does indeed return 55.

As a bonus assignment, modify your range function to take an optional third argument that indicates the “step” value used when building the array. If no step is given, the elements should go up by increments of one, corresponding to the old behavior. The function call range(1, 10, 2) should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Make sure this also works with negative step values so that range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].

// Your code here.

console.log(range(1, 10));
// → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
console.log(range(5, 2, -1));
// → [5, 4, 3, 2]
console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
// → 55

Reversing an array
Arrays have a reverse method that changes the array by inverting the order in which its elements appear. For this exercise, write two functions, reverseArray and reverseArrayInPlace. The first, reverseArray, should take an array as its argument and produce a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order. The second, reverseArrayInPlace, should do what the reverse method does: modify the array given as its argument by reversing its elements. Neither may use the standard reverse method.

Thinking back to the notes about side effects and pure functions in the previous chapter, which variant do you expect to be useful in more situations? Which one runs faster?

// Your code here.

let myArray = ["A", "B", "C"];
console.log(reverseArray(myArray));
// → ["C", "B", "A"];
console.log(myArray);
// → ["A", "B", "C"];
let arrayValue = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
reverseArrayInPlace(arrayValue);
console.log(arrayValue);
// → [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

A list
As generic blobs of values, objects can be used to build all sorts of data structures. A common data structure is the list (not to be confused with arrays). A list is a nested set of objects, with the first object holding a reference to the second, the second to the third, and so on:

let list = {
  value: 1,
  rest: {
    value: 2,
    rest: {
      value: 3,
      rest: null
    }
  }
};
The resulting objects form a chain, as shown in the following diagram:

A diagram showing the memory structure of a linked list. There are 3 cells, each with a value field holding a number, and a 'rest' field with an arrow to the rest of the list. The first cell's arrow points at the second cell, the second cell's arrow at the last cell, and the last cell's 'rest' field holds null.
A nice thing about lists is that they can share parts of their structure. For example, if I create two new values {value: 0, rest: list} and {value: -1, rest: list} (with list referring to the binding defined earlier), they are both independent lists, but they share the structure that makes up their last three elements. The original list is also still a valid three-element list.

Write a function arrayToList that builds up a list structure like the one shown when given [1, 2, 3] as argument. Also write a listToArray function that produces an array from a list. Add the helper functions prepend, which takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the input list, and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns the element at the given position in the list (with zero referring to the first element) or undefined when there is no such element.

If you haven’t already, also write a recursive version of nth.

// Your code here.

console.log(arrayToList([10, 20]));
// → {value: 10, rest: {value: 20, rest: null}}
console.log(listToArray(arrayToList([10, 20, 30])));
// → [10, 20, 30]
console.log(prepend(10, prepend(20, null)));
// → {value: 10, rest: {value: 20, rest: null}}
console.log(nth(arrayToList([10, 20, 30]), 1));
// → 20

Deep comparison
The == operator compares objects by identity, but sometimes you’d prefer to compare the values of their actual properties.

Write a function deepEqual that takes two values and returns true only if they are the same value or are objects with the same properties, where the values of the properties are equal when compared with a recursive call to deepEqual.

To find out whether values should be compared directly (using the === operator for that) or have their properties compared, you can use the typeof operator. If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a deep comparison. But you have to take one silly exception into account: because of a historical accident, typeof null also produces "object".

The Object.keys function will be useful when you need to go over the properties of objects to compare them.

// Your code here.

let obj = {here: {is: "an"}, object: 2};
console.log(deepEqual(obj, obj));
// → true
console.log(deepEqual(obj, {here: 1, object: 2}));
// → false
console.log(deepEqual(obj, {here: {is: "an"}, object: 2}));
// → true
